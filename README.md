# Two_team_Cross_Screening
This repository contains the data and R codes to reproduce all the tables and figures in the manuscript namely, "Exploration, Confirmation, and Replication in the Same Observational Study: A Two Team Cross-Screening Approach to Studying the Effect of Unwanted Pregnancy on Mothersâ€™ Later Life Outcomes". 

1) Codes: The R codes to generate the tables and figures are placed in two different folders - one for the tables and figures in the main paper, and the other for those in the supplementary document. R codes are named in such a way that one can identify the corresponding table / figure easily. For example, if the name of the R code contains the phrase "Figure 7.1", that means it will generate Figure 7.1 in the paper.
  
2) Data: The main master data can be downloaded from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4y7emw2qlwqk8xyno0ac1/AA3M7IX2CG223KtXpuMogLw?rlkey=iim5i0if7ew2evho083rh6epe&st=5nrhulhv&dl=0 . It was not possible to upload the master data here in gihub due to size issue. Some supporting data files have been placed in the data folder here.
