This repository contains the data and R codes to reproduce all the tables and figures in the manuscript namely, "Exploration, Confirmation, and Replication in the Same Observational Study: A Two Team Cross-Screening Approach to Studying the Effect of Unwanted Pregnancy on Mothers’ Later Life Outcomes". 

=====================================================================
1) Codes: The R codes to generate the tables and figures are placed in two different folders - one for the tables and figures in the main paper, and the other for those in the supplementary document. The details of the R code files are as follows:

Folder "R Codes for main paper" contains the following codes (see the descriptions for each):
1.Figure 4.3_Left_panel_p_values.R -Generates the p-values displayed in the left panel of Figure 4.3.
2.Figure 4.3_Right_panel_p_values.R -Generates the p-values displayed in the right  panel of Figure 4.3
3.Figure 5.1.R -Generates the p-values displayed in Figure 5.1.

Folder "R Codes for the supplementary document" contains the following codes (see the descriptions for each):
1.Table D.1.R - Creates Table D.1 
2.Table D.2.R - Generates Table D.2 
3.Table D.3.R - Produces Table D.3
4.Table D.5_Right_panel_p_values.R – Generate the p-values displayed in the right panel of Table D.5 
5.Table D.5_Left_panel_p_values.R - Generate the p-values displayed in the left panel of Table D.5 
6.Table D.6.R - Produces Table D.6
7.Figure D.1.R - Generates Figure D.1
8.Figure C.1.R - Creates Figure C.1
9.Figure D.2_Left_panel_Love_plot.R - Produces the Love plot in the left panel of Figure D.2
10.Figure D.2_Right_panel_Love_plot.R - Produces the Love plot in the right panel of Figure D.2
11.Figure F.1.R - Generates Figure F.1

2) Data: The main master data can be downloaded from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4y7emw2qlwqk8xyno0ac1/AA3M7IX2CG223KtXpuMogLw?rlkey=iim5i0if7ew2evho083rh6epe&st=5nrhulhv&dl=0 . It was not possible to upload the master data here in gihub due to size issue. Some supporting data files have been placed in the "Data" folder here. The "Data" folder contains the following csv files (see the descriptions for each)
